                He is 45 years old. He is married with two boys. He values spending time with his family
                camping, fishing, hiking and cross country skiing. It is important for him to know what to
                expect from the weather so that he can be prepared. He would also expect an accurate
                and current angler report so that he can teach his sons how to fish in the best possible
                spots.
